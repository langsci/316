## Description
The goal of this monograph is to explore the relationship between the cognitive notion
of number and various grammatical devices expressing this concept in natural language
with a special focus on Slavic. The book aims at investigating different morphosyntactic 
and semantic categories including plurality and number-marking, individuation and
countability, cumulativity, distributivity and collectivity, numerals, numeral modifiers
and classifiers, as well as other quantifiers. It gathers 19 contributions tackling the main
themes from different theoretical and methodological perspectives in order to contribute
to our understanding of cross-linguistic patterns both in Slavic and non-Slavic languages.
